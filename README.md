# MyDigitailResume10
My project is my resume but in a website format

I just Visual Studio Code for the writing the project 

The biggest challenge that I faced was the  placement of the images

In the future I would like to add the logos of every place I work at with the description

###Things that changed from Resume9 to Resume 10
Changed the sidebar to the Navigation bar and fixed it to the top
I removed the about information and the profile photo from the header and added it to card element with all my information
